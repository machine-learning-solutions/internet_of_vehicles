# VMAS Simulator

## Overview
The VMAS Simulator is a sophisticated simulation platform designed for vehicle mobility and signal transmission studies. This environment integrates advanced vehicular models and communication protocols to simulate realistic scenarios in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) interactions.

## Tools Used
- **Editor**: VS Code
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, tkinter for GUI
- **Libraries**: VMAS (a custom library for simulation)

## Recent Updates
### Version 1.0.0
- **Release Title**: Initial Release of VMAS Simulator
- **Release Description**: Launch of the complete simulation environment capable of modeling complex vehicular movements and communications.
- **Release Date**: October 1, 2024
